# manuscripta2

This is a start on an Angular2 version of the client
app for http://www.manuscripta.io. The REST api
server is at http://xdoc-api.herokuapp.com/v1/test
At the moment it displays the HTML content
of two test document files. then appends a list of
documents from the REST API.  
I am working on documenting the API.

Next step:  get MathJax working.

For the current version, see

  http://www.manuscripta.io
  
You are invited to create an account.  I very
much need feedback on the functionality of the app,
which is primarily a platform for writing and distributing
technical content using asciidoc and asciidoc-latex.

The current front-end is written in Angular 1.*. 
The backend is a ruby app written using the Hanami
framework.

INSTALLATION:

Prerequesites: `node`, `npm`

To test, run `npm install`, then `npm start`.  

I have had to run `npm install rxjs@5.0.0-beta.12`, before and/or after `npm install`, even though that file is in my `package.json`.  This is no doubt due the fact that Angular2 is still in Beta.  

I updated two entries in `package.json`, but there may be others that are out of date.  Please let me know if that is the case.
