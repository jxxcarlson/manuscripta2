# manuscripta2
This is a start on an Angular2 version of the client
app for http://www.manuscripta.io.  

At the moment it simply diplays the HTML content
of two test document files.

The next step is to build in a REST interface to the 
backend server at http://xdoc-api.io, e.g.,

  http://xdoc-api.io/v1/documents/jc.thanks
  
I am also working on documenting the API.

For the current version, see

  http://www.manuscripta.io
  
You are invited to create an account.  I very
much need feedback on the functionality of the app,
which is primarily a platform for writing and distributing
technical content using asciidoc and asciidoc-latex.

The current front-end is written in Angular 1.*. 
The backend is a ruby app written using the Hanami
framework.
